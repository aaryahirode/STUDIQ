Discovery of\nmultilayered perceptron (also referred to as multilayered\nnetworks) independently by several researchers eventually\nrestored interest in this field.\nBackpropagation Network\n\nThe limitation of a single layer perceptron is overcome by\nmultilayer neural nets. It is proved that a multilayer\nfeedforward net can be made to learn any continuous function\nto any extent of desired accuracy.\nThe learning method called the generalized delta rule, or back-\npropagation (of errors), is employed to train the multilayer\nfeedforward networks. It is essentially gradient descent method\nto minimize the total squared error of the output computed by\nthe net. The learning is supervised.\nMULTI-LAYER FEEDFORWARD NETWORK\n\nThe single layer net has very limited capability. It is unable\nto learn such a simple function as the 2-input XOR.\nMultilayer perceptron has the capacity to overcome this\nlimitation. A multilayer network with one or more hidden\nlayers can learn any continuous mapping to an arbitrary\naccuracy.\nMoreover, it is proved that one hidden layer is suffi cient\nfor a multilayer perceptron to implement any\ncontinuous function. However, in some cases, more than\none hidden layer may be advantageous.\nMULTI-LAYER FEEDFORWARD NETWORK\n\nArchitecture\n\nTh e processing elements of a multi-layer feedforward\nneural net are arranged in a number of layer. The layers\nintermediate between the input and the output layers are\ncalled the hidden layers. The connecting paths are\nunidirectional. They are directed from the input layer to the\noutput layer. Signals flow from the input to the output\nthrough the hidden layers and not in the reverse direction.\nThe name feedforward is due to the unidirectional flow of\nsignal from the input to the output layer. During learning,\nthe net adjusts its interconnection weights on the basis of\nthe errors in computation.\nArchitecture\n\nCalculation of errors starts at the output layer and the\nerrors are propagated backward, i.e., from the output\nlayer towards the input layer. Because of this backward\npropagation of errors during the learning phase these nets\nare called backpropagation nets. The structure of an m-p-\nn multilayer net with one hidden layer . It can be easily\ngeneralized to nets having move than hidden layers. The\nbiases to the hidden units and the output units are\nprovided by the units X0 and H 0 respectively, each of\nwhich is permanently fed with the signal 1. The biases to\nthe hidden units H1, …, Hp as v01, v02, …, v0p.\nSimilarly, those to the output units Y1, …, Yn are given by\nw01, …, w0n.\nMULTI-LAYER FEEDFORWARD NETWORK\n\nx is input training pattern of length m.\nx = [ x1, … , xi, …, xm ]\ny_out Output pattern produced by the activations of the\noutput units Y1, …., Yn.\ny_out = [y_out1, …, y_outk, …, y_outn ]\nt Target output pattern for input pattern x.\nt = [ t1, …, tk, …, tn]\nh_out Pattern produced by the activations of the hidden units\nH1, …, Hp. h_out = [ h_out1, …, h_outj, …, h_outp ]\nXi The ith input unit. The signal to input unit Xi is symbolized as\nxi. The activation of Xi is also xi, as it simply broadcasts the input\nsignal xi, without any processing, to the units of the hidden\nlayer.\nMULTI-LAYER FEEDFORWARD NETWORK\n\nHj The jth hidden unit, j = 1, .., p.\nThe total input signal to Hj is given by\nWhere vij is the interconnection weight between the\ninput unit Xi and the hidden unit Hj,\nvoj is the bias on the hidden unit Hj.\nh_outj The activation of the jth hidden unit Hj.\nh_outj = fh ( h_inj ), where fh is the activation function for\nthe hidden units.\nMULTI-LAYER FEEDFORWARD NETWORK\n\nYk The kth output unit, k = 1, …, n. Th e total input signal to\nYk is given by\nWhere wjk is the interconnection weight between the\nhidden unit Hj and the output unit Yk\nwork is the bias on the output unit Yk.\ny_outk\nThe activation of the output unit Yk.\ny_outk = fo ( y_ink ), where fo is the activation function for\nthe output units.\nMULTI-LAYER FEEDFORWARD NETWORK\n\nδ(wk) A component of error correction weight adjustment\nfor wjk, j = 0, …, p, that is due to an error at output Yk.\nMoreover, δk is propagated to the hidden units to further\ncalculate the error terms at the hidden units.\nδ(vj) A component of error correction weight adjustment for\nvij, i = 0, …, m. δ(vj) results from the backpropagation of error\ninformation from the output units to the hidden unit Hj.\na Learning rate\nBackpropagation Algorithm\n\nBackpropagation is a supervised learning method where the\nnet repeatedly adjusts its interconnection weights on the basis\nof the error, or deviation from the target output, in response\nto the training patterns.\nAs usual, learning takes place through a number of epochs.\nDuring each epoch the training patterns are applied at the\ninput layer and the signals flow from the input to the output\nthrough the hidden layers.\nCalculation of errors starts at the output layer and the errors\nare propagated backward, i.e., from the output layer towards\nthe input layer\nBackpropagation Algorithm\n\nBackpropagation Algorithm\n\nBackpropagation Algorithm\n\nBackpropagation Algorithm\n\nBackpropagation Algorithm\n\nBackpropagation Algorithm\n\nThank You"

Smidth & Co. ( 1980 )\n-\nFirst to market fuzzy expert systems.\nFUZZY LOGIC IN CONTROL SYSTEMS\n\n➢Fuzzy Logic provides a more efficient and\nresourceful way to solve Control Systems.\n➢\nSome Examples\n▪Temperature Controller\n▪Anti – Lock Break System ( ABS )\nTEMPERATURE CONTROLLER\n\nThe problem\nChange the speed of a heater fan, based on the room\ntemperature and humidity.\n\nA temperature control system has four settings\nCold, Cool, Warm, and Hot\n\nHumidity can be defined by:\nLow, Medium, and High\n\nUsing this we can define the fuzzy set.\nTEMPERATURE CONTROLLER\n\n\nFuzziness/Vagueness/Inexactness\nThe expressions as rich , very, expensive, old, weak etc. are\nextremely convenient in practical communication.\nThey are characteristically inexact in the sense that there are no\nwell-defined demarcations between rich and poor, very and little,\nexpensive and cheap, old and young, or weak and strong.\nA person can be rich as well as poor simultaneously, of course to\ndifferent extents. This vagueness is desirable ,otherwise everyday\nconversation would have been impossible.\nHowever, the classical set theory is not equipped to handle such\nvagueness as it does not allow an element to be a partial\nmember, or a partially non-member, of a set simultaneously.\nTherefore classical set theory is inadequate to model our intuitive\nnotion of a set in general.\nFuzzy set theory\n\nFuzzy set theory takes into consideration the natural vagueness\nthat we the human beings deal with in our practical, daily life.\nAs an example, let us consider the data related to a family as\ndescribed below in Table\nSet Membership\n\nIt is customary to refer to a classical set as crisp in order\nto differentiate it from a fuzzy set.\nThe crisp set of the family members U = {Grand-pa,\nGrand-ma, Dad, Mom, Sister, Brother, Aunt} may be\ntreated as the reference set, or the universe of discourse.\nMembership Function\nGiven an element x and a set S, the membership of x with\nrespect to S, denoted as m S (x), is defined as\nSet Membership\n\nLet us consider the set M of male family members and set F of\nfemale family members with reference to the family presented\nin Table 2.1.\nWe see that m M (Dad) = 1, and m M (Mom) = 0. Similarly, m F\n(Dad) = 0, and m F (Mom) = 1.\nMembership values of the other family members in M and F can\nbe ascertained in similar manner.\nNow, consider A to be the set of senior persons in the family.\nSeniority is a familiar and frequently used attribute to a\nperson. But is there any clear and unambiguous way to\ndecide whether a person should be categorized as senior or\nnot?\nSet Membership\n\nWe may agree without any hesitation that Grand-pa, being\n72 years old, is a senior person, so that Grand-pa A.\nOn the other hand the brother and the sister are both too\nyoung to be categorized as senior persons.\nTherefore, we may readily accept that Daughter A and Son\nA. What about Mom, or Dad?\nThey are not as aged as Grand-pa but neither as young as the\ndaughter or the son.\nMoreover, Grand-ma is almost a senior person, being at 63\nyears, but she might be categorized as a middle-aged person\nas well.\nMembership Function\n\nQuite often it is convenient to express the membership of\nvarious elements with respect to a fuzzy set with the help of a\nfunction, referred to as the membership function.\nFor any x U, we may determine the membership value of x in\nA with the help of the following\nmembership function.\nMembership Function\n\nFor Grand-ma we have mA (Grand-ma) = (63 – 30) / 40 =\n33 / 40 = 0.825. Hence Grand-ma is a senior person to a\nlarge extent, but not as fully as Grand-pa.\nMembership Function\n\nTherefore, the fuzzy set A of senior\npersons can be expressed as a set of ordered pairs A\n= {(Grand-pa, 1.0), (Grand-ma, 0.825), (Dad, 0.275),\n(Mom, 0.2), (Aunty, 0.55)}.\nFuzzy Sets\n\nA fuzzy set F on a given universe of discourse U is defined as a\ncollection of ordered pairs (x, mF (x)) where x U, and for all\nx U, 0.0 mF (x) 1.0\nF = {(x, mF (x)) x U, 0.0 mF (x) 1.0}\nClassical sets, often referred to as crisp sets to distinguish them\nfrom fuzzy sets, are special cases of fuzzy sets where the\nmembership values are restricted to either 0 or 1.\nEach pair (x, mF (x)) of the fuzzy set F is known as a singleton.\nNotation (Fuzzy sets) Apart from enumerating the singletons as\ndescribed above, fuzzy sets are frequently expressed as the\nunion of all singletons where a singleton is denoted as mF (x) / x.\nUsing this notation\nFuzzy Sets\n\nHere the summation sign ⅀is to be interpreted\nas union over all singletons, and not arithmetic\nsum.\nFor continuous sets, the summation notation is\nreplaced by the integral sign , as shown below.\nThank You"

Since a set is defi\nned by its members without\nregard to ordering or repetitions, the set of atomic particles cited above\nis identical to the set {proton, neutron, electron}, or the set {neutron,\nproton, neutron, electron, proton, proton}\nThere are two ways to describe a set. The most obvious one is by\nenumerating the members of the set.\nHowever, occasionally it is convenient to describe a set by citing a\nproperty common to all the members of the set. Both of these kinds of\nset notations are exemplified below.\nExample\nSet and Set Notations\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\nTh e sets A, B, C, D given below are described by enumeration of its\nmembers.\nA = {Jack, Jill, hill, pail, water}\nB = {+, −, ×, ÷}\nC = {Socrates, toothbrush, loneliness, 235}\nD = {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday}\nTh e set D of all days of a week can be equivalently expressed by citing\nthe property shared by its member. Thus,\nD = {x | x is a day of the week}\nA few other sets described in similar way are\nE = {x | x is an integer, and -1 x +1}}= {−1, 0, +1}\nF = {x | x is a prime number}\nG = {x | x is a polygon}\nH = {x | x is an element having 8 electrons in its outermost shell}\nThe Null Set and the Universal Set\n\nThere are two specially interesting sets, viz. the null (empty) set\nand the universal set. These are usually represented by the symbols and U,\nrespectively. Th e null set is the set without any member, so that | | = 0.\nThe universal set, on the other hand, is the set of all possible elements\nin a certain context.\nLet X be the set of all natural numbers that are divisible by 4 but not divisible\nby 2. As there is no such integer which is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 2,\nX = .\nSimilarly, the set of positively charged electrons is also the null set.\nMoreover, we may define a set S = {x | x is blue-eyed} in the context of the\nuniversal set of all human beings. Then S is the set of all blue-eyed persons\nand U is the set of all human beings. However, if U is the set of all living\ncreatures, then S is the set of all blue-eyed creatures including, but not\nlimited to, all blue-eyed human beings.\nSubset\n\nAn element x is said to belong to a set S, expressed as x S, if x is\nincluded in S. Otherwise x does not belong to S, written as x S. For\nexample, for the set F = {x | x is a prime number}, 3 F, as 3 is a prime\nnumber, but 4 F.\nA set T is said to be a subset of set S, written as T S, if every element\nof T is in S, i.e., For all () x if x T, then x S. Equivalently, S is\nsuperset of T, symbolized as S T, if and only if T is a subset of S.\nT is a proper subset of S, denoted as TS, if T S and T S.\nHence, if T S, then there is at least one member x such that x S but\nx T.\nFor an arbitrary set S the following properties are obvious from\nthe definitions cited above.\n(i) S, (ii) S U (iii) S S\nEquality of Sets\n\nEquality of Sets\nTwo sets S and T are equal if every element of S is in T and vice versa.\nIn other words, S = T, if and only if, S T and T S.\nPower Set\nGiven a set S, the power set of S, denoted as P (S), or 2𝑠, is the set of all\nsubsets of S.\nExample 2.5\nMoreover, the chain rule applies to set inclusion operation, i.e., for any\nthree sets A, B, C, if A B and B C, then A C.\nOperations on Sets\n\nThere are three basic operations on sets, union (), intersection (), and\ncomplementation ( ).\nSet Union\nGiven two sets P and Q, the union of P and Q, denoted as P Q, is the\nset of all elements either in P, or in Q, or in both P and Q.\nP Q = {x | x P or x Q}\nSet Intersection\nGiven two sets P and Q, the intersection of P and Q, denoted as\nP Q, is the set of all elements both in P, and Q.\nP Q = {x | x P and x Q}\nOperations on Sets\n\nComplement of a Set\nThe complement of P, denoted as P , P , ￢P, or P, is the set\nof all elements (of U) outside P.\nP = {x | x P}\nThere are various notations for complementation, as indicated in the\ndefinition\nDifference between Sets\nThe difference of set P from Q, denoted as P – Q, is the set\nof all elements in P but not in Q.\nP – Q = {x | x P and x Q}\nIt is easy to prove that P – Q = P Q \nVenn Diagrams\n\nIt is convenient to represent a set theoretic expression visually with the\nhelp of a diagram called Venn diagram. Usually, a Venn diagram consists of a\nrectangle presenting the universal set U with other sets presented with the\nhelp of circles / ovals inside the rectangle.\nVenn Diagrams\n\nCartesian Product\nLet P and Q be two sets. The Cartesian product of P and Q, denoted as P × Q,\nis the set of all ordered pairs (x, y) such that x P and y Q.\nP × Q = {(x, y) | x P and y Q}\nProperties of Sets\n\nProperties of Sets\n\nFeatures of Fuzzy Sets\n\nFuzzy sets are often characterized with certain features, e.g.,\nnormality, height, support, core, cardinality etc. These features reveal\nthe nature and structure of a fuzzy set.\nFeatures of Fuzzy Sets\n\nFeatures of Fuzzy Sets\n\nFuzzy Membership\n\nFuzzy Membership\n\nThank You"

The nature of the membership function\ndepends on the context of the application. For example, what is hot\nwith respect to human body temperature is certainly very cool for a\nblast furnace.\nFuzzy sets are usually described with simple membership\nfunctions.\nA few parameterized functions that are quite frequently\nused for this purpose are given below along with their graphical\nrepresentations.\nFUZZY MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\n(a) Triangular function\nPerhaps the most frequently used membership function is the triangular\nfunction.\nFUZZY MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\n(b) Trapezoidal function\nIts shape is similar to that of a triangular function except that instead of a\nsharp peak, it has a flat peak.\nFUZZY MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\n(c) Gaussian function\nAnother widely used membership function is the Gaussian function.\nFUZZY MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\n(d) S-function\nThe step function can be approximated by the S-function as closely\nas required by adjusting the parameters a and b.\nThe point m = (a + b) / 2 is known as the crossover\npoint of the S-function.\nTransformations\n\nThere are a few simple but useful transformations often applied to fuzzy\nmembership functions. Normalization, dilation, concentration, contrast\nintensification and fuzzification are widely used.\nThese transformations are briefly discussed in this subsection. The\neffects of these transformations on Gaussian functions are shown\ngraphically.\n(a) Normalization:\nThe normalization operation\nconverts a subnormal fuzzy set F to\na normal fuzzy set. It is obtained by\ndividing each membership value by\nthe height of the fuzzy set.\nTransformations\n\n(b) Dilation: This operation ‘flattens’ the membership function so that it\nattains relatively higher values and consequently the overall shape of the\nmembership function gets dilated. In other words, the resultant function\nis less pointed around the higher membership values.\nTransformations\n\n(c) Concentration: Concentration has the reverse effect of dilation. Here\nthe function attains relatively lower values and consequently it gets more\npointed around the higher membership values.\nTransformations\n\n(d) Contrast Intensification: Contrast intensification is achieved by\nreducing the membership values that are less than 0.5 and elevating those\nwith values higher that 0.5\nTransformations\n\n(e) Fuzzification: Fuzzification produces the reverse effect of contrast\nintensification. Here the membership values that are less than 0.5 are\nelevated while those with a value more than 0.5 are reduced.\nLinguistic Variables\n\nThe transformations presented above are useful while dealing with the so\ncalled linguistic variables.\nConventional variables usually have numeric or alphanumeric string\nvalues. In contrast, a linguistic variable may have one of a number of\nallowable words, or phrases, as its value. Each of these legitimate\nlinguistic values corresponds to a fuzzy set.\nFor instance, consider the variable Height. As a conventional variable it may\nhave any real number as its value. But as a linguistic variable it’s value is\nallowed to be one of a few predefined words, say {short, average, tall}.\nWe may define a fuzzy set for each of the words short, average, and tall.\nNow, consider the attribute very tall. Here the word very may be viewed as a\ntransformation applied to the fuzzy meaning of tall. One can reasonably\nimplement very with the help of the concentration operation. The reason is\nconcentration reduces the magnitude of the membership value.\nTransformation on Fuzzy Membership functions\n\nTransformation on Fuzzy Membership functions\n\nOPERATIONS ON FUZZY SETS\n\nOPERATIONS ON FUZZY SETS\n\nOPERATIONS ON FUZZY SETS\n\nOPERATIONS ON FUZZY SETS\n\nOPERATIONS ON FUZZY SETS\n\nOPERATIONS ON FUZZY SETS\n\nOPERATIONS ON FUZZY SETS\n\nProperties of fuzzy set operations\n\nFuzzy Relations\n\nCartesian product\nLet A and B be two sets. Then the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted by\nA × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) such that a A, and b B.\nA × B = {(a, b) a A, and b B}\nSince (a, b) (b, a) we have in general A × B ) (B × A). Hence the operation\nof Cartesian product is\nnot commutative.\nFuzzy Relations\n\nGiven two crisp sets A and B, a crisp relation R between A and B is a\nsubset of A × B.\nA crisp relation between sets A and B is conveniently expressed with the\nhelp of a relation matrix T. The rows and the columns of the relation\nmatrix T correspond to the members of A and B respectively.

Fuzzy logic\nextends crisp logic by\naccepting the possibility\nof the infinite shades\ntruths between absolute\nfalsehood and absolute\ntruth.\nFuzzy Propositions\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\nFuzzy logic operations\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\nFuzzy Controllers\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\nSensor or any other inputs are fed to the controller through the input values\nand mapped to membership values of appropriate fuzzy sets. This is the\nfuzzification step.\nThe processing stage carries some manipulations on the basis of the fired rules\nto obtain fuzzy sets relating to the consequent parts of the fired rules. Finally,\nthe outcome of the processing stage on each rule are combined together to\narrive at a crisp value for each control parameter. This is carried out during the\noutput stage and is termed as defuzzification.\nBlock Diagram of Fuzzy Controllers\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\nFuzzy Air Conditioner Controller\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\nFuzzy Air Conditioner Controller\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\nLet us consider a highly simplified version of an air-conditioner (AC). Its\nfunction is to keep track of the room temperature and regulate the\ntemperature of the air flown into the room. Th e purpose is to maintain\nthe room temperature at a predefined value.\nFor the sake of simplicity we assume that the AC does not regulate the flow\nof air into the room, but only the temperature of the air to be flown.\nLet T0 be the desired room temperature. The air conditioner has a\nthermometer to measure the current room temperature T.\nThe difference T = T −T0 is the input to the controller. When T 0, the\nroom is hotter than desired temperature and the AC has to blow cool air\ninto the room so that the room-temperature comes down to T0. If, on the\nother hand, T 0, the room needs to be warmed up and so, the AC is to\nblow hot air into the room. In order to achieve the required temperature of\nthe air to be blown into the room, a ‘dial’ is turned at the appropriate\nposition within the range [−1, +1].\nFuzzy Air Conditioner Controller\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\nA positive value of the dial means hot air will be blown, and a negative\nvalue means cold air will be blown. The degree of hotness, or coldness, is\ndetermined by the magnitude of the dial position. No air is blown when\nthe dial is at 0. The input to the fuzzy controller is T = T − T0, and the\noutput is D, i.e., the position to which the AC dial is to be turned. Both T\nand D are crisp values, but the mapping of T to D takes place with the\nhelp of fuzzy logic.\n(a) Fuzzy sets: Occasionally, for fuzzy control systems, it is convenient to\ncategorize the strength of the input and the output parameters with the\nhelp of certain fuzzy sets referred to as Large Negative(LN), Medium\nNegative (MN), Small Negative (SN), Zero (ZE), Small Positive (SP), Medium\nPositive (MP), Large Positive (LP) etc. Th ese are indicative of the magnitude\nof the respective parameters in the context of the given application. For the\nsystem under consideration, the fuzzy sets defined on the input\nparameter T and D are LN, MN, ZE, MP, and LP.\nFuzzy Air Conditioner Controller\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\nFor example, membership of T to Medium Positive (MP) is zero for T 0,\nand T . Th e said membership increases uniformly as T increases from\n0 to 3, becomes 1 at 3, and then uniformly diminishes to 0 as T approaches\n6 from 3.\nFuzzy Air Conditioner Controller\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\n(b) Fuzzy rule base: Th e system under consideration has a simple rule base\nconsisting of five fuzzy rules. These are listed below.\nFuzzy Air Conditioner Controller\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\nTh e input to the system is T, which is first fuzzified with the help of the\nfuzzy sets membership functions LN, MN, ZE, MP, LP for T. Depending on\nthe result of this fuzzification, some of the rules among R1, …, R5 are fired.\nAs a result of this fi ring of rules, certain fuzzy sets are obtained out of the\nspecification of LN, MN, ZE,MP, LP for D. These are combined and defuzzified\nto obtain the crisp value of D as the output.\nFuzzy Air Conditioner Controller\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\nFuzzy Classification\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\nFuzzy Classification\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\nFuzzy Classification\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\nFuzzy Decision Making\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\nThank You"

This is the\nonly activation function we have used so far in this text.\nMathematically the step function is defined as follows.\nFig. 6.31(a) shows the shape of the basic step function\ngraphically. Occasionally, instead of 0 a non-zero\nthreshold value q is used. Th is is known as the threshold\nfunction and is defined as\nStep/Threshold Function\nStep/Threshold Function\nStep/Threshold Function\nOccasionally, it is more convenient to work with bipolar data,\n−1 and +1, than the binary data. If a signal of value 0 is sent\nthrough a weighted path, the information contained in the\ninterconnection weight is lost as it is multiplied by 0.\nTo overcome this problem, the binary input is converted to\nbipolar form and then a suitable bipolar activation function is\nemployed. Accordingly, binary step functions have their bipolar\nversions.

The most widely used range is from −1 to +1, and\nthe corresponding sigmoid function is referred to as the bipolar\nsigmoid function.\nSigmoid Activation Function\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\nHyperbolic or tanh Function\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\nAnother bipolar activation function that is widely employed in\nANN applications is the hyperbolic tangent function.

When the input\ndata is binary and not continuously\nvalued in the range from 0 to 1,\nthey are generally converted to\nbipolar form and then a bipolar\nsigmoid or hyperbolic tangent\nactivation function is applied on\nthem by the processing unit.\nHyperbolic or tanh Function\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\nAND Perceptron\nLec-2: Introduction to AI\n\nOR Perceptron\n\nXOR Decision Boundary\n\nAugmented Vectors\n\nAn artificial neuron is characterized by its weight\nvector v, threshold θ and activation function. During\nlearning, both the weights and the threshold are\nadapted. To simplify learning equations, the input\nvector is augmented to include an additional input\nunit, zI+1, referred to as the bias unit.\nThe value of zI+1 is always -1, and the weight vI+1\nserves as the value of the threshold. The net input\nsignal to the AN (assuming SUs) is then calculated\nas\nAugmented Vectors\n\nThe value of zI+1 is always -1,\nand the weight vI+1 serves as\nthe value of the threshold.\nwhere θ = zI+1vI+1 = −vI+1.\nIn the case of the step function, an\ninput vector yields an output of 1\n\nAn input vector yields an output of 0\nGradient Descent Learning Rule\n\nWhile gradient descent (GD) is not the first training rule\nfor ANs, it is possibly the approach that is used most to\ntrain neurons .GD requires the definition of an error\nfunction to measure the neuron’s error in approximating\nthe target.\nThe sum of squared errors is usually used.\nwhere tp and op are respectively the\ntarget and actual output for the\np-th pattern, and PT is the total\nnumber of input-target vector pairs\n(patterns) in the training set.\nGradient Descent Learning Rule\n\nThe aim of GD is to find the weight values that minimize\nE. This is achieved by calculating the gradient of E in\nweight space, and to move the weight vector along the\nnegative gradient\nweights are updated using\nWith\nWhere\nGradient Descent Learning Rule\n\nand η is the learning rate (i.e. the size of the steps taken in\nthe negative direction of the gradient). The calculation of\nthe partial derivative of f with respect to netp (the net input\nfor pattern p) presents a problem for all discontinuous\nactivation functions, such as the step and ramp functions;\nzi,p is the i-th input signal corresponding to pattern p.\nThe Widrow-Hoff learning rule presents a solution for the step\nand ramp functions, while the generalized delta learning rule\nassumes continuous functions that are at least once\ndifferentiable.\nWidrow-Hoff Learning Rule\n\nassume that f = netp ,\nWeights are then updated using\nThe Widrow-Hoff learning rule, also referred to as the least-means-\nsquare (LMS) algorithm , was one of the first algorithms used to train\nlayered neural networks with multiple adaptive linear neurons. This\nnetwork was commonly referred to as the Madaline .\nGeneralized Delta Learning Rule\n\nThe generalized delta learning rule is a generalization of\nthe Widrow-Hoff learning rule that assumes differentiable\nactivation functions. Assume that the sigmoid function\nis used. Then,\nFor the error-correction learning rule it\nis assumed that binary-valued\nactivation functions are used, for\nexample, the step function. Weights\nare only adjusted when the neuron\nresponds in error. That is, only when\nThank You"
